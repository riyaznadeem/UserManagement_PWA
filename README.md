Angular 18 Application Overview
1. Frontend Framework

Angular 18: Modern version of Angular, supporting modular architecture, reactive forms, and advanced features like standalone components (if used).

Bootstrap: For responsive and mobile-first UI design. Provides consistent styling across components.

2. UI/UX Features

Tostr Notifications: For user feedback such as success, error, or warning messages.

Responsive Design: Using Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure compatibility across devices.

3. Authentication & Authorization

JWT Authentication:

Secure login mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Tokens are stored securely (e.g., in localStorage or sessionStorage) and used in HTTP headers via an interceptor.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Components and actions are protected based on user roles.

Conditional rendering of UI elements depending on the user’s permissions.

4. HTTP & Interceptors

HTTP Interceptor:

Automatically attaches JWT token to outgoing requests.

Handles global error handling (e.g., token expiration, unauthorized access).

5. Forms & Validation

Reactive Forms:

Forms are fully reactive, supporting dynamic validation and real-time error messages.

Custom validators can be implemented for complex validations.

6. User Management Module

CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, delete users.

Secure Operations: Access is restricted to authorized roles (e.g., admin).

User Data Management: Includes fields like username, email, role, and possibly token management.

7. Multilingual Support

Language Translation Service:

Two types of translation:

JSON-based translation: Load key-value pairs from JSON files for multi-language support.

Hard-coded translation: Inline translation values stored within the same service for quick use.

Provides seamless switching between languages in the UI.

8. Security Features

Secure login and token management.

Role-based UI rendering and action restriction.

Interceptors to prevent unauthorized API calls.

Reactive form validation to prevent client-side vulnerabilities.

9. Overall Architecture

Modular Angular structure: Separate modules for User Management, Auth, Shared Components, etc.

Services for reusable logic: JWT handling, API calls, language translation.

Components are designed to be reusable, maintainable, and secure.
